A reaction ticket system of discord improved by ReeLee.

###How to setup:

- Create a channel and send a message to which people will react to make a ticket.

-   Write anywhere "!config message_id category_id".  Replace "!" with the bot prefix and message_id with the id of message where the bot will add reaction and "category_id" with the id of the category where the tickets will be created.

- Make sure that you have a folder called "tickets" in the same directory as the main file.

-  In line 55 replace the channel id with the id where you want the transcripts to be uploaded.
